# SensorDataPipeline

Welcome to the **SensorDataPipeline** repository! This project provides a comprehensive backend architecture for handling sensor data through an efficient pipeline that integrates with modern AI methodologies for predictive analytics.

## Overview

- **Data Ingestion**: Utilizes Kafka for real-time data streaming from sensors or mock data generators for testing purposes.
- **Data Processing**: Employs Python for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, including feature engineering and data normalization to prepare data for analysis.
- **Data Storage**: Offers options for local SQLite storage for on-premises setups or integration with cloud databases like AWS RDS or Azure SQL for scalability.
- **AI/ML Integration**: Features an AI model server with Linear Regression for simple predictions, with potential for expansion into advanced ML models (Random Forest, LSTM) and Generative AI.
- **Frontend Integration**: While this repository focuses on backend operations, it lays the groundwork for a frontend dashboard using web frameworks like Flask or Django to visualize data and predictions.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to work both on-premises and in the cloud, providing flexibility in deployment.
- **AI-Driven Predictions**: Incorporates machine learning for real-time predictions and anomaly detection.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Uses Python, Kafka, SQLite, and cloud services for data handling and storage.
- **Generative AI**: Encourages the use of AI for code generation, system design, data analysis, and UI enhancement.

## Usage

This repository can be used as a foundation for projects involving IoT sensor data, real-time analytics, or any application requiring a robust data pipeline with AI integration. Developers can extend the backend functionalities or develop a corresponding frontend to interact with the processed data.
